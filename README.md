# Iron Without a Crown: The Weight of the Banner

Iron Without a Crown: The Weight of the Banner is a long-form, narrative-driven 3D strategy RPG focused on leadership without authority, power without titles, and the long-term consequences of responsibility.

The player takes the role of a knight who refuses the crown and instead becomes the military and strategic commander of a fractured realm. Rather than ruling by decree, the player leads through decisions, loyalty, and sacrifice — shaping the future of the country over extended in-game years.

This project is designed as a **persistent world experience**. There is no definitive ending; the world continues to evolve based on the player’s actions, failures, and compromises.

## 🎯 Design Vision

Iron Without a Crown is built around the idea that leadership is a burden, not a reward.

Key design goals:
- Power exists beyond formal titles
- Decisions create delayed and irreversible consequences
- Stability is fragile and must be constantly maintained
- Moral choices rarely have clean or optimal outcomes

The game emphasizes **systems over scripted victory**, allowing stories to emerge naturally through play.

## 🧠 Core Pillars

- **Endless Progression**  
  The game does not end. Nations rise, weaken, recover, and transform over time.

- **Command Without a Crown**  
  The player influences armies, territories, and institutions without absolute authority.

- **Strategic & Moral Weight**  
  Choices affect political stability, military loyalty, civilian trust, and future conflicts.

- **Living World**  
  Factions, regions, and structures evolve independently, reacting to the player’s long-term behavior.

## 🏛️ Long-Term Systems (Planned)

- Dynamic territories and regions
- Military command and delegation
- Persistent institutions and structures that grow, decay, or fracture over time
- Large-scale conflicts, invasions, and mythical threats
- World events that reshape politics and borders
- Multiple coexisting power centers rather than a single ruling state

These systems are intended to support **continuous gameplay without a final state**.
